# Red-Wine-Quality-Predictor

Second year assignment using R to create a step-wise and AIC linear regression model to predict the quality of red wine using a provided dataset. 

The assignment was more focused on the Executive Summary, as such the code documentation and coding style wasn't the primary focus.
