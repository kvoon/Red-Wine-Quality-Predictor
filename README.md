# Red-Wine-Quality-Predictor

This project was completed as part of a second-year undergraduate Data Science coursework, where the main objective was to create a simple Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting outcome variables. The dataset was randomly assigned by the course coordinator, and I was tasked with working on a wine dataset, with wine quality as the target variable. I developed a straightforward linear regression model using a backwards step-wise approach and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to forecast the quality of red wine.

It's important to note that this assignment was not primarily focused on the development of a predictive ML model but rather on documenting the entire process. The quality of the executive summary and the thoroughness of the documentation were prioritized over the quality of the ML model and its predictive performance.
