# Red-Wine-Quality-Predictor

This project was part of a second-year undergraduate Data Science coursework, where the objective was to construct a basic Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting outcome variables. The dataset used was randomly assigned by the course coordinator, and I was tasked with working on a wine dataset. In this dataset, the target variable was wine quality. Consequently, I developed a straightforward linear regression model using a step-wise approach and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to forecast the quality of red wine.

The model and the subsequent Executive Summary were constructed using R and R Studio. Given that the primary focus of the assignment was on creating a high-quality executive summary, the documentation and coding style were not emphasized to the same extent as the quality of the executive summary itself.
